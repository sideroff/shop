`pip install -r requirement.txt`  
Please note that this will install the dependencies globally.  

When you want to add a new dependency, run:  
`pip freeze`  
and copy the specific dependency you need to the requirements.txt file.

#### Folder structure
The application uses a variation of 'Atomic design' by Brad Frost. The difference between the original and this is that here we don't have templates, but have added a root category.
